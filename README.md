# 268bypasser

ALL WORKED CREATED BY FISHY.

Q & A:
# How do I use this?
  - Compile the DLL and inject into the second process after waiting 30 seconds.
# What's this do?
  - When you inject a detected DLL, Roblox gives it a score and if that score is too high you will get a 30 minute HWID ban, this DLL removes that checker.
# Is this unbannable?
  - Although it bypasses their HWID kicks, Roblox may still detect you through other means. This is by no means a FULL bypass, but it will get rid of the kicks, for best experience use an ALT account, if your game has teleports you will need to reinject the DLL.
